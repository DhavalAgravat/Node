(1) To Start with ejs 

--  Install ejs library 
---> npm i ejs

(2) Set-Up for ejs 

--  Create folder named views
--  Then create your wanted file using extension ejs (eg: index.ejs)
--  Can use ejs file as htmml file and  write html code into it

-- Then set up "view engine" for ejs
-- use ser method in app to set view engine 
-- first atg engine name second arg extension name 
---> app.set('view engine', "ejs")

(3) Using ejs to render file in response of request in server for API

-- as we do for endpoint use render method for response and provide ejs filename in args without extension to render it
---> response.render("index");

(4) Now to pass value in render method in showing it to  our ejs file we can use following syntax 

-- To pass value
---> response.render('index',{name:'Void'})

-- To use this value in ejs file
---> <%= name %>
---> Eg :  
    <body>
        <h1>Home Of HTMl EJS</h1>
        <h2>Welcome <%= name%></h2>
    </body>

(5) ejs good practises

-- using locals instead of value only
-- as we know we can access value using <%= name %> but what if sometime value's key is misspelled or we want to access key which isn't passed in that case  we get error 

-- To counter this error we use locals, 
---> locals is whole object we passes {}

instead of <%= name %> we will do
---> <%= locals.name %>

-- in this case if value-key pair doesn't exist it will not gave any igly error
